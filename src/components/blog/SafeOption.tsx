          Startup culture is taking over the modern world and is quickly
          becoming a popular choice for youngsters. A great place to start your
          entrepreneurial journey is deciding whether you want to build your own
          business from scratch - study the industry, do your research, build
          your product based on market needs. Or you could just franchise!
          Choose a well-flourished business that has already established itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          But how is becoming a franchise owner the safer option? The biggest
          advantage of owning a franchise is - you are investing in a business
          that is already tested and proven. The risks relating to profit and
          profit are lowered to quite a good extent, which helps a lot,
          especially if you do not have previous experience in the business.
        </p>

          Launching your own business from the ground up poses a multitude of
          challenges, including growing a customer base, establishing brand name
          and reputation, and managing it all with few effective forms of
          support or guidance. These challenges can make or break your business,
          which is why statistically 90% of startups fail within two years of
          launching!
        </p>

        <p>
          What if you had hands-on support and an established operational system
          to kick off your business with? That's exactly what franchising
          offers. It's not just about using the brand name that is already
          widely hot, it is a proven concept that entrepreneurs who invest in
          franchises with a good business model are more successful. They have
          the advantage of established operations and processes compared to
          those launching their startups from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from the security, franchising provides a myriad of other
          benefits like:{" "}

          <br />
          Buying a franchise allows you to work in a field that you have
          interest, but virtually no experience in. Most franchisors offer
          extensive and thorough training and support to help their franchisees
          understand the company’s operations. By entering into an already
          established brand, you will be privy to the trade secrets, knowledge
          and experience that would’ve taken a long period of trial and errors
          to uncover.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2 className="font-semibold"> Limited Risk</h2>
          When you purchase a franchise, you are buying an established concept
          that is successful. Statistics show that franchises have a much better
          chance of success than independent start-up businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2 className="font-semibold"> Training and Mentorship</h2>
          When you buy a franchise, you have a partner offering you a balance
          between being a leader in your own rights and receiving constant
          support and hands-on training programs. You also benefit from the
          franchisor's vast knowledge and experience of launching, operating and
          growing a business, acquired over years of perfecting a business
          model.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2 className="font-semibold"> Connections and Links</h2>
          As the franchisor has already built strong business relations, you
          will be able to benefit from these relations. This makes it easier to
          establish a working relationship to get access to other franchises and
          conventions. You can also benefit from the franchisor’s collective
          buying power, thus receiving materials and services at a lower rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investing in a franchise offers a sense of security that no other
          venture could offer. With the right franchise and business ideas,
          being a franchisee can indeed be the fast track to success.
